# Project: Implementation of Basic Ciphers
## Introduction
Our project is connected with some ciphers, whitch will be made by VHDL on the FPGA development board Nexys A7 50-T. There are some of these ciphers.

## Theoretical description of the ciphers
### Caesar cipher:
One of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.
