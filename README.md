# Project: Implementation of Basic Ciphers
## Introduction
Our project is connected with some ciphers, whitch will be made by VHDL on the FPGA development board Nexys A7 50-T. There are some of these ciphers. This project aims to demonstrate various simple ciphers, such as the Vernam Cipher, Caesar 
Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and potentially others, using basic logic gates and flip-flops on the Nexys A7 
FPGA board. Each cipher enabling users to input plaintext messages and observe the resulting ciphertext 
generated by the encryption process. Buttons and switches can serve as input devices for users to input 
plaintext messages and control the encryption/decryption process. LEDs can provide visual feedback 
on the status of the encryption/decryption process, indicating ready to receive input, encryption/decryption 
in progress, and complete. The 7-segment display shows the ciphertext or plaintext output

## Theoretical description of the ciphers
### Caesar cipher:
One of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext

#### Advantages:
1) Easy to implement and use thus, making suitable for beginners to learn about encryption.
2) Can be physically implemented, such as with a set of rotating disks or a set of cards, known as a scytale, which can be useful in certain situations.
3) Requires only a small set of pre-shared information.
4) Can be modified easily to create a more secure variant, such as by using a multiple shift values or keywords.
### Vernam cipher:
Vernam Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It is one of the Substitution techniques for converting plain text into cipher text. In this mechanism, we assign a number to each character of the Plain-Text, like (a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, … z = 25). 
In the Vernam cipher algorithm, we take a key to encrypt the plain text whose length should be equal to the length of the plain text

#### Advantages of the Vernam Cipher
1) Perfect Secrecy: With a truly random and unpredictable key of the same length as the message, the charnum cipher provides perfect confidentiality. This means that, in theory, an encrypted message provides no information about the original message.
2) Unbreakable with a Truly Random Key: In theory, if the key stream were truly random and used only once (hence the name “one-time pad”), the Vernam cipher would be unbreakable. The key stream is the same length as the message, and the likelihood of any decryption of the ciphertext is equal.
3) No Pattern Recognition: Unlike other encryption algorithms, the Vernam cipher does not produce a pattern of ciphertext that can be used to break the code. Each character of the ciphertext is encrypted independently.
4) Simple Algorithm: Both the encryption and decryption algorithms are simple and involve a bitwise XOR operation. This simplicity can be an advantage in some situations.

### Atbash cipher:
Atbash cipher is a substitution cipher with just one specific key where all the letters are reversed that is A to Z and Z to A. It was originally used to encode the Hebrew alphabets but it can be modified to encode any alphabet. The Atbash cipher is a particular type of monoalphabetic cipher formed by taking the alphabet (or abjad, syllabary, etc.) and mapping it to its reverse, so that the first letter becomes the last letter, the second letter becomes the second to last letter, and so on. For example, the Latin alphabet would work like this:

#### Advantages of the Atbash Cipher
Since its just an affine cipher with both a = 25 = b we don’t need to write separate functions for encryption and decryption. We can re-use the same function for both purposes. 



## Software description and testbenches
We use this alphabeth to display different letters.

Testbench for atbash cipher. Input is letter "a" and output is letter "z", for "b" the output is "y" and so on. We can see the program is working correctly.
Other testbenches are working in the same way but for different cipher.

## Future upgrades
We want to update our programme to show color when using one of the ciphers. For example if you choose atbash cipher, the red LED will be turned on. And use this idea for the rest of the ciphers.
